# Logistic Regression Classification Project

Overview
This project demonstrates a Logistic Regression classification model applied to a dataset for predicting the target variable based on features. The dataset is processed and analyzed using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn, with the results evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

The requirements.txt file includes:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

seaborn


Dataset
The dataset used for this classification task is named logit classification.csv. It consists of multiple features and a target variable. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.


Implementation
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using pandas.

Feature Selection: The features used for prediction are selected from the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Features are standardized using scikit-learn's StandardScaler to improve the model's performance.

Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using:

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy Score

Classification Report

Bias and Variance


Evaluation
1. Confusion Matrix:
The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions:

True Positives (TP)

False Positives (FP)

True Negatives (TN)

False Negatives (FN)

2. Accuracy:
The accuracy score indicates the percentage of correct predictions made by the model on the test data.

3. Classification Report:
This includes precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class in the target variable.

4. Bias & Variance:
The model's bias is the accuracy on the training data, and variance is the accuracy on the testing data. These are used to determine if the model is overfitting or underfitting.

Usage
To run the model on your own machine:
